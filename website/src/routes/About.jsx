                Since I was young I've been enamoured by technology! My Father would always bring home the latest tech 
                and show us all the new crazy features the device had. Fast forward several years and I'd be building my own PC 
                so I could game and surf the web. Then when I got into college I felt quite lost until I took my first programming class.
                It was here that I remembered all the times growing up as a kid being amazed by technology, again I experienced this amazement and never
                looked back.
